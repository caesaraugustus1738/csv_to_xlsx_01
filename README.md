# csv_to_xlsx_01
[Testing using a branch to update and then commit to main]. Converts and formats a CSV to XLSX.

This script accepts a specifically formatted CSV (included in the repository).
This CSV emulates an export from a shot management software or shot database.
The purpose of this project is to familiarise myself with converting CSV to XLSX files, and manipulating XLSX files.
This script could be used by a coordinator who needs to export shot data and present a pretty Excel to the client.
This script saves the time taken to manually format spreadsheets each time the client wants an update.

.bat file for Windows use. Edit the path in the .bat file to the .py script location.
Drag and drop CSVs onto the .bat file to convert them.
