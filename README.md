# csv_to_xlsx_01
Converts and formats a CSV to XLSX
This script accepts a specifically formatted CSV (included in the repository).
It emulates an export from a shot management software or shot database.
The purpose of this project is to familiarise myself with converting CSV to XLSX files, and manipulating XLSX files.
This script could be used by a coordinator who needs to export shot data and present a pretty Excel to the client.
This script saves the time taken to manually format spreadsheets each time the client wants an update.
